# AgroLens

## Project Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with **Professor Dr. Torsten Schön** from **Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt** and **MI4People gGmbH**. The aim was to find a reliable estimate of soil quality samples using Sentinel-2 satellite data as a free alternative to laboratory tests. Multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated to achieve this goal.

## Purpose
Efficient nutrient management and precise fertilization are essential for advancing modern agriculture, particularly in regions striving to optimize crop yields sustainably. The AgroLens project endeavors to address this challenge by developing Machine Learning (ML)-based methodologies to predict soil nutrient levels without reliance on laboratory tests. By leveraging state of the art techniques, the project lays a foundation for actionable insights to improve agricultural productivity in resource-constrained areas, such as Africa.

The approach begins with the development of a robust European model using the LUCAS Soil dataset and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to estimate key soil properties, including phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, and pH levels. This model is then enhanced by integrating supplementary features, such as weather data, harvest rates, and Clay AI-generated embeddings.

This repository contains the code to the data preprocessing strategies and ML pipelines employed in this project. Advanced algorithms, including Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), were implemented and fine-tuned for precise nutrient prediction. Results showcase robust model performance, with root mean square error values meeting stringent accuracy thresholds.


## Repository structure
- **nutrients_predictor/**: Implementation of the ML models developed during the project
